# Used-Car-Price-Predictor

#PROJECT ABSTRAT: 
 Using machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, random forest, we tried to develop a statistical model that will be able to predict the price of a used car based on certain features such as previous consumer data like number of kilometers the car has already travelled, the year in which it was manufactured,etc. 
 
 For the training data, we used Beautiful Soup to scrape data from Cars24.com. We cleaned the data and used it to train the model.
